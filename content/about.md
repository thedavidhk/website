## What I Do

My core work is in backend services, data processing, and microservice architecture — typically in **Rust**, **C/C++**, and **Python**. I've designed and built systems that handle high data volumes under strict correctness and performance requirements, from individual services to the interactions between them.

What I value most in software is clarity. Clean interfaces that hide complexity. Small surface areas that make large systems manageable. I'd rather remove code than add it — the best abstraction is often the one that lets you delete something.

I use AI tools where they genuinely help, with the same scrutiny I'd apply to any dependency: useful when understood, dangerous when trusted blindly. The engineering judgment stays with the engineer.

## Background

My path to software engineering came through economics. I completed graduate studies and pursued a PhD in Financial Market Regulation before deciding to commit fully to building software. That background still shapes how I work — reasoning about trade-offs, modeling constraints, and thinking in systems are as central to good architecture as they are to economic analysis.

Outside of my day job, I build [developer tooling](/projects/c3pg/) and spend time in the Rust ecosystem, where I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of performance, safety, and ergonomics.
