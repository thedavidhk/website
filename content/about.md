## What I Do

I'm a software engineer specializing in backend services and data processing systems. My day-to-day work involves designing and implementing high-performance, reliable systems — the kind of software that needs to process large volumes of data efficiently and correctly.

My primary languages are **Rust** (my favorite), **C/C++**, and **Python**. I value code that is clear, well-tested, and maintainable over code that is merely clever.

## Background

Before committing fully to software engineering, I studied economics and pursued a PhD focused on Financial Market Regulation. I chose to leave academia to follow my passion for building software — a decision I haven't regretted. That said, the analytical thinking and rigor from economics continue to serve me well.

Until recently I also gave guest lectures at universities, which I genuinely enjoyed. Teaching has a way of deepening your own understanding, and I'd welcome an opportunity to mentor or teach again in the future — likely focused on software engineering this time, though economics still fascinates me.

## Side Interests

In my spare time I've spent a fair amount of time on **game development** — most recently with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and Rust, but also previously in C and C++. I've never shipped a game (yet), but the intersection of systems programming, real-time rendering, and creative problem-solving keeps pulling me back.

I also build developer tooling — see [c3pg](/projects/c3pg/), a Cargo-inspired build tool for C++ projects.
