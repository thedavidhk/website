## What I Do

I build backend systems — usually in Rust, C/C++, and Python — with a focus on correctness, performance, and keeping
complexity under control. I’ve worked on systems that handle high data volumes under strict correctness and performance
constraints — from single services to the architecture that ties them together.

What I value most in software is clarity. Clean interfaces that hide complexity. Small surface areas that make large
systems manageable. I'd rather remove code than add it — the best abstraction is often the one that lets you delete
something.

I use AI tools where they genuinely help, and I treat them like any other dependency: powerful when understood, risky
when trusted blindly. The judgment still has to stay with the engineer.

## Background

I came to software engineering through economics. I completed graduate studies and pursued a PhD in Financial Market
Regulation before deciding to build systems instead of models. That background still shapes how I work — reasoning about
trade-offs, modeling constraints, and thinking in systems are as central to good architecture as they are to economic
analysis.

Outside of my day job, I build developer tooling (like [c3pg](/projects/c3pg/)) and spend time in the Rust ecosystem.
I’m particularly drawn to the intersection of performance, safety, and ergonomics.

I’m interested in the incentives behind systems — technical and organizational. Most complexity doesn’t come from code
alone, but from the trade-offs and constraints around it.
